# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 12, 2020


**Today's Progress**: - I finally pushed out my PvZ Randomizer to the public.

**Thoughts:** - I actually had about 10 minutes left when I was getting the program ready for a public release. I made lots of small changes along the way to let the user know what worked and what didn't work at the time. I plan to make some of the currently unavailable features available in the next update.

### Day 2: May 13, 2020


**Today's Progess**: - Added more funcionality to my Randomizer program.

**Thoughts:** - I spent a little more than an hour to get all that I needed to get done today, but I was fine with it at the end of the day.
