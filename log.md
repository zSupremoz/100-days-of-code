# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 12, 2020


**Today's Progress**: - I finally pushed out my PvZ Randomizer to the public.

**Thoughts:** - I actually had about 10 minutes left when I was getting the program ready for a public release. I made lots of small changes along the way to let the user know what worked and what didn't work at the time. I plan to make some of the currently unavailable features available in the next update.

### Day 2: May 13, 2020


**Today's Progress**: - Added more funcionality to my Randomizer program.

**Thoughts:** - I spent a little more than an hour to get all that I needed to get done today, but I was fine with it at the end of the day.

### Day 3: May 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: - Learned about pulling Lists from a class file in C#.

**Thoughts:** - May be a great opportunity to make my code look less messy.

### Day 4: May 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: - Started development on a GitHub page that I'll use for a custom way to download my latest releases.

**Thoughts:** - I think it has a lot of potential, I just need to learn more about HTML and CSS.

### Day 5: May 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: - Decided to start making Pre-Releases for my Randomizer so people can see what I'm doing to it each day when I work on it.

**Thoughts:** - I wish I had more time to work on this today, but I had more important things to do.

**Thoughts:** - Looks way better than it did compared to when it first started out.

### Day 7: May 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: - GitHub page has been made available to the public.

**Thoughts:** - I want to learn some more about web development for future plans.
